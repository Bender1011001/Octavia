# Agent Tycoon RL Agent Development Plan

## 1. Baseline and Infrastructure

- **Integrate Stable RL Libraries:** Use [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) or [RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/rllib/index.html) for rapid prototyping.
- **Environment Wrappers:** Ensure your `AgentTycoonEnv` is fully Gym-compatible (it appears to be), and add wrappers for normalization, logging, and custom reward shaping if needed.
- **Reproducibility:** Set up experiment tracking (e.g., Weights & Biases, MLflow).

## 2. Agent Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Strong Baseline Agents

- **Deep RL Algorithms:** Start with proven algorithms:
  - PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
  - SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
  - DQN (Deep Q-Network, for discrete action variants)
- **Network Architecture:**
  - MLPs for tabular/low-dimensional data
  - Add LSTM/GRU layers if temporal dependencies are important
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Normalize/scale observations
  - Add technical indicators or engineered features if useful

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use Optuna or Ray Tune for automated search.
- **Reward Shaping:** Experiment with reward functions to encourage desired behaviors (risk-adjusted return, drawdown minimization, etc.).
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple agents (e.g., voting, weighted portfolios).

### Phase 3: Novelty and Advanced Techniques

- **Meta-RL:** Agents that adapt their strategy online (e.g., RL^2, MAML).
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Competing or cooperating agents (market simulation, adversarial training).
- **Hierarchical RL:** High-level manager agent allocates capital among sub-agents with specialized strategies.
- **Explainability:** Use attention mechanisms or post-hoc analysis to interpret agent decisions.

## 3. Training & Evaluation

- **Training Loop:** Use distributed training for faster convergence.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
  - Outperformance vs. HODL bot and random agent
- **Backtesting:** Run agents on historical data and simulated shocks.
- **Live Simulation:** Integrate with your visualization dashboard for real-time monitoring.

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement

- **Automated Retraining:** Periodically retrain agents as environment or data changes.
- **Leaderboard:** Track and compare agent performance over time.
- **Experimentation Platform:** Make it easy to plug in new agent architectures or RL algorithms.
